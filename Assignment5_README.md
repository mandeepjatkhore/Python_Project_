# 🧾 Python Assignment – Dictionary and List Slicing

This assignment includes two basic Python tasks focused on dictionary operations and list slicing. Follow the instructions carefully to implement the required functionality.

## ✅ Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### 🎯 Objective:
Develop a Python program that performs the following:
1. Creates a dictionary where student names are the keys and their marks are the values.
2. Prompts the user to enter a student's name.
3. Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks for the entered name.
4. If the student's name does not exist in the dictionary, display a message indicating that the student is not found.

### 🛠️ Guidelines:
- Use a predefined dictionary with at least 4 student entries.
- Use user input to accept the student’s name at runtime.
- Make sure to handle cases where the entered name is not in the dictionary.
- Display appropriate messages for both successful and unsuccessful lookups.

## ✅ Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### 🎯 Objective:
Create a Python program that:
1. Generates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Extracts the first five elements from this list using slicing.
3. Reverses the sliced portion of the list.
4. Prints both the sliced list and the reversed list.

### 🛠️ Guidelines:
- Use list slicing to extract a portion of the list.
- Use either slicing or a built-in method to reverse the extracted list.
- Clearly print both the original sliced list and its reversed version for verification.

## 📌 Notes:
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled.
- Do not use any external libraries.
- Focus on clean and readable code with meaningful variable names.
- Add inline comments where necessary to explain logic.
